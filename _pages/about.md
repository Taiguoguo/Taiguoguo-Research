# About My Research

This is an interdisciplinary project exploring how music affects sleep. I combined music analysis, neuroscience and data processing methods to understand the impact of different musical elements on sleep quality.

## Research Background

Modern people generally face sleep problems, and music, as a non-drug intervention, has potential application value. My research aims to systematically explore the relationship between music and sleep.

## Methodology (Planned Approach)

Based on my current research design, I plan to:

1. Music Analysis Phase
    Collect and analyze diverse music samples, focusing on acoustic features such as spectrum, rhythm, harmony, and tempo.

2. Experimental Design
   Conduct controlled sleep studies to investigate how specific musical elements influence sleep patterns and quality

3. Data collection
  Record physiological signals during sleep, including EEG (brain waves), heart rate, and movement data.

4. Data Analysis
   Apply statistical methods and machine learning models to identify correlations between music characteristics and sleep metrics.

   *This methodology represents my proposed reasearch framework and may be refined as the project develops.*


## Vision

I hope this research can provide personalized music recommendations for people with sleep disorders and improve their sleep quality. 


## Planned Analysis

### 1. Spectral Analysis of Music
- Compare frequency distributions of relaxing vs. stimulating music
- Identify acoustic features correlated with sleep onset

### 2. Sleep Architecture Analysis
- Analyze sleep stages (N1,N2 N3, NERM) under different music conditions
- Measure sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset (WASO)

### 3. Statistical Modeling
- Use linear mixed people to account for individual differences
- Machine learning: Predict sleep quality from music features

  ## My Approach: Connecting Music, Sleep, and Data

  I work at the interseciton of three fields:

  1. **Music Analysis** - Studying what makes music relaxing or stimulating
  2. **Sleep Science** - Measuring how our brain and body sleep
  3. **Data Science** - Finding patterns in the relationship between music and sleep

  
*This referenece list represents the methodological foundation of my current work. I continue to review emerging literautre in music neuroscience and sleep science.* 



*I am actively expanding this literature base as my research progresses.*

### Adolescent Sleep: Theoretical Frameworks and Practical Challenges
**Galván, A. (2020).** The need for sleep in the adolescent brain. *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, 24(1), 79-89. 


#### 1. **Developmental Science Perspective**
   "Although sleep loss is a normative psychosocially and biologically driven developmental process, it occurs alongside behaviours that characterize adolescene, including deepening cognitive sophisticaiton, improved emotion regulation, and intensifying social cognition, calling into question how sleep may impact these developmental milestones" (Galván, 2020, p.82).

#### 2. **Real-World Sleep Constraints**
   Galván documents cases such as "Student A"- whose school schedule permits only 7 hours 50 minutes of sleep nightly-illustrating how environmental and social demands frequently restrict adolescents to suboptimal sleep durations.

#### Connection to My Music-Sleep Research:
This work provides the essential dual foundation for my project:
- **Theoretical**: Establishes why sleep is critically important for adolescent brain development and functioning.
- **Practical**: Demonstrates the widespread occurrence of insufficient sleep, creating a clear need for accessible, non-invasive interventions.

By showing both *why* adolescent sleep matters and *how often* it is compromised, Galván's analysis directly motivates my investigation into whether personlized music listening could serve as a feasible, engaging method to improve sleep quality within these real-world constraints. 


     
 
  This unique combination allows me to ask new questions and find practical solutions for sleep improvement through music.
