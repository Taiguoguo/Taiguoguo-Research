# About My Research

This is an interdisciplinary project exploring how music affects sleep. I combined music analysis, neuroscience and data processing methods to understand the impact of different musical elements on sleep quality.

## Research Background

Modern people generally face sleep problems, and music, as a non-drug intervention, has potential application value. My research aims to systematically explore the relationship between music and sleep.

## Methodology (Planned Approach)

Based on my current research design, I plan to:

1. Music Analysis Phase
    Collect and analyze diverse music samples, focusing on acoustic features such as spectrum, rhythm, harmony, and tempo.

2. Experimental Design
   Conduct controlled sleep studies to investigate how specific musical elements influence sleep patterns and quality

3. Data collection
  Record physiological signals during sleep, including EEG (brain waves), heart rate, and movement data.

4. Data Analysis
   Apply statistical methods and machine learning models to identify correlations between music characteristics and sleep metrics.

   *This methodology represents my proposed reasearch framework and may be refined as the project develops.*


## Vision

I hope this research can provide personalized music recommendations for people with sleep disorders and improve their sleep quality. 


## Planned Analysis

### 1. Spectral Analysis of Music
- Compare frequency distributions of relaxing vs. stimulating music
- Identify acoustic features correlated with sleep onset

### 2. Sleep Architecture Analysis
- Analyze sleep stages (N1,N2 N3, NERM) under different music conditions
- Measure sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset (WASO)

### 3. Statistical Modeling
- Use linear mixed people to account for individual differences
- Machine learning: Predict sleep quality from music features

  ## My Approach: Connecting Music, Sleep, and Data

  I work at the interseciton of three fields:

  1. **Music Analysis** - Studying what makes music relaxing or stimulating
  2. **Sleep Science** - Measuring how our brain and body sleep
  3. **Data Science** - Finding patterns in the relationship between music and sleep

  ## Key references

### 1. My first reference
“Although sleep loss is a normative psychosocially and biologically driven developmental process, it occurs alongside behaviours that characterize adolescence, including deepening cognitive sophistication, improved emotion regulation, and intensifying social cognition, calling into question how sleep may impact these developmental milestones. (Adriana Galvan, 2020).”

### 2. My second reference
As demonstrated by student A, the sleeping patterns is form 5:50 AM wake up and sleep at 10:00PM, total duration approximately 7 hours 50 minutes. The whole sleeping duration is it sufficient, it needs to connect sleeping quality and daytime productivity as comprehensive assessment. Galván, A. (2020). The Need for Sleep in the Adolescent Brain. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 24(1),79-89.

### Additional Literature Under Review
- Music-sleep interaction studies
- Acoustic feature extraction methods
- Personalized intervention frameworks

*I am actively expanding this literature base as my research progresses.*
