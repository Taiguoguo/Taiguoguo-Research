# about my research

This is an interdisciplinary project ot explore how music affects sleep. I combined music analysis, neuroscience and data processing methods to try to understand the impact of different musical elements on sleep quality.

## Research background

Modern people generally face sleep problems, and music, as a non-drug intervention, has potential application value. My research aims to systematically explore the relationship between music and sleep.

## Method

- collect music samples of different styles and analyse their spectrum, rhythrm, harmony and other characteristics.

- Design sleep experiments to record the physiological signals of participants(such as heart rate, brain waves)

- Use statistical methods and machine learning models to analyse data and find the relationship between music characteristics and sleep indicators

## Vision

I hope this research can provide personalised music recommendations for people with sleep disorders and improve their sleep quality.
