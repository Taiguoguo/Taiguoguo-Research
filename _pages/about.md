# About My Research

This is an interdisciplinary project exploring how music affects sleep. I combined music analysis, neuroscience and data processing methods to understand the impact of different musical elements on sleep quality.

## Research Background

Modern people generally face sleep problems, and music, as a non-drug intervention, has potential application value. My research aims to systematically explore the relationship between music and sleep.

## Methodology (Planned Approach)

Based on my current research design, I plan to:

1. Music Analysis Phase
    Collect and analyze diverse music samples, focusing on acoustic features such as spectrum, rhythm, harmony, and tempo.

2. Experimental Design
   Conduct controlled sleep studies to investigate how specific musical elements influence sleep patterns and quality

3. Data collection
  Record physiological signals during sleep, including EEG (brain waves), heart rate, and movement data.

4. Data Analysis
   Apply statistical methods and machine learning models to identify correlations between music characteristics and sleep metrics.

   *This methodology represents my proposed reasearch framework and may be refined as the project develops.*


## Vision

I hope this research can provide personalized music recommendations for people with sleep disorders and improve their sleep quality.
